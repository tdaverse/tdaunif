\title{Sample (with noise) from ellipses}
\usage{
sample_ellipse(n, ar = 1, sd = 0)

sample_cylinder_elliptical(n, ar = 1, width = 1, sd = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of observations.}

\item{ar}{Aspect ratio for an ellipse (ratio of major and minor radii).}

\item{sd}{Standard deviation of (independent multivariate) Gaussian noise.}

\item{width}{Width of the cylinder (with respect to the fixed radius of the
ellipse).}
}
\description{
These functions generate uniform samples from configurations of
ellipses of major or minor radius 1 in 2- or 3-dimensional space,
optionally with noise.
}
\details{
The function \code{sample_ellipse()} uses the usual sinussoidal parameterization
from the unit interval to an ellipse with radii 1 and \code{1/ar}. The uniform
sample is generated through a rejection sampling process as described by
Diaconis, Holmes, and Shahshahani (2013).

# ellipses in 2-space
x <- sample_ellipse(120, ar = 6)

x <- sample_ellipse(120, ar = 1/6)
plot(x, asp = 1, pch = 19, cex = .5)

# ellipses in 2-space
