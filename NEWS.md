A new sampler for the rotoid embedding of the MÃ¶bius strip in 3-space.

# next version

This patch fixes miscalculated coordinates for interlocked tori (`sample_tori_interlocked()`) that caused an error and adds an example to ensure that the sampler runs without error.

# tdaunif 0.1.0

This first minor version contains several common samplers, stratified samplers for cubes in any dimension, and a function factory for custom rejection samplers.
